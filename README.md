# VS Code Setup

My personal Visual Studio Code configuration — optimized for focus, performance, and clean workflow.

This repo includes:
- `settings.json` → Core preferences and editor tweaks  
- `keybindings.json` → Custom shortcuts for speed and comfort  
- `extensions.txt` → List of all installed extensions
